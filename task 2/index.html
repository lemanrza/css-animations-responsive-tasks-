      <h3>Elaboration about Generic Page</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Recently, the US Federal government banned online casinos from
          operating in America by making it illegal to transfer money to them
          through any US bank or payment system. As a result of this law, most
          of the popular online casino networks such as Party Gaming and
          PlayTech left the United States. Overnight, online casino players
          found themselves being chased by the Federal government. But, after
          a fortnight, the online casino industry came up with a solution and
          new online casinos started taking root. These began to operate under
          a different business umbrella, and by doing that, rendered the
          transfer of money to and from them legal. A major part of this was
          enlisting electronic banking systems that would accept this new
          clarification and start doing business with me. Listed in this
          article are the electronic banking systems that accept players from
          the United States that wish to play in online casinos.
